# Cookies and Sessions

A comprehensive guide and implementation reference for understanding and working with cookies and sessions in web applications.

## Overview

This repository provides insights into two fundamental mechanisms for maintaining state in web applications:

- **Cookies**: Small pieces of data stored on the client-side that are sent with every HTTP request
- **Sessions**: Server-side storage mechanisms that maintain user state across multiple requests

## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored in the user's browser. They consist of key-value pairs and are automatically sent with HTTP requests to the domain that set them.

### Common Use Cases
- User authentication and authorization
- Tracking user preferences and settings
- Shopping cart management
- Analytics and tracking
- Personalization

### Cookie Attributes
- `Expires/Max-Age`: Controls cookie lifetime
- `Domain`: Specifies which domains can access the cookie
- `Path`: Defines the URL path scope
- `Secure`: Ensures transmission only over HTTPS
- `HttpOnly`: Prevents JavaScript access (XSS protection)
- `SameSite`: Controls cross-site request behavior

## What Are Sessions?

Sessions are server-side storage mechanisms that maintain user state across requests. A session ID is typically stored in a cookie, while the actual session data resides on the server.

### Benefits of Sessions
- Enhanced security (data stored server-side)
- Larger storage capacity
- Better control over data lifecycle
- Reduced client-side payload

### Session Management
Sessions typically involve:
1. Creating a unique session identifier
2. Storing session data on the server
3. Sending the session ID to the client (usually via cookie)
4. Validating and retrieving session data on subsequent requests

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices
- Always use `Secure` flag for cookies in production
- Implement `HttpOnly` to prevent XSS attacks
- Set appropriate `SameSite` values to mitigate CSRF
- Use strong, unpredictable session IDs
- Implement session timeouts
- Regenerate session IDs after login
- Store sensitive data server-side, not in cookies
